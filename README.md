## 1- About The Project

In Database System's Lecture, we learned alot about database systems. And at the end of the semester we were required to build a GUI application that can perform different SQL queries. A classic approach would be using Java Swing Library with JDBC. But I didn't do that. 
I had about a year of experience building projects with Spring Framework. And I know how powerful it is. Altough I have always built the backend of the projects and never really got a chance to try creating UI. 

For this I picked <a href ="https://vaadin.com/"> Vaadin Framework</a>. It is a framework built on top of Spring, to create Progressive Web Applications. 

It took a while to learn all the components but the results were worth it!

## 4- Problems

This project is built for Database Systems project and because of the deadline it contains serious bad practices such as:
- It is open to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp">SQL Injection</a>. 
- Passwords are not hashed. 
  
**Please do not use it in anything serious.**
